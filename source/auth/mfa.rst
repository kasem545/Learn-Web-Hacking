Multi-factor authentication
========================================
Multi-factor authentication is a method used when single-factor authentication is not sufficient to ensure security. It usually introduces multiple ways to verify user identity. The authentication method can be based on knowledge, i.e. password; it can also be based on article authentication, such as hardware key; it can also be based on feature authentication, such as biometric features including fingerprints, etc.

Specifically, the commonly used biometric features currently include: fingerprints, faces, iris, veins, voiceprints, body shapes, etc. Commonly used evaluation indicators are mainly speed (registration, identification and usage time), accuracy (false positive, false negative), etc.
