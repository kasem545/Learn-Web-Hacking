Evolution of cyber attack and defense technology
========================================

Historical development
----------------------------------------
In 1939, Turing cracked Enigma, ending the war two years earlier. This was an earlier time when computer security began to appear in people's vision. At this time, computer computing power was limited, and the offense and defense methods used by people were relatively primary.

In 1949, John Von Neumann proposed the design of a self-replicable program, which is considered the world's first computer virus.

Between 1970 and 2009, with the continuous development of the Internet, network security began to enter people's vision. In the early stages of network development, many systems were zero protection and security awareness had not yet been popularized. Many systems were designed only to consider usability and did not consider much security. Therefore, at that time, it was possible to easily obtain data or permissions in combination with search engines and some integrated penetration testing tools.

In 1972, a buffer overflow attack was proposed by Computer Security Technology Planning Study.

In 1984, Ken Thompson introduced how he added backdoors to the compiler to obtain Unix permissions, which was also an earlier supply chain attack.

In 1988, a student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) wrote Morris Worm for the purpose of testing, which caused great damage to the Internet at that time.

In the same year, CMU's CERT Coordination Center (CERT-CC) formed the first computer emergency response team to deal with the damage caused by Morris Worm to the Internet, and then many countries, regions and groups around the world built it. CERT, SRC and other organizations.

Also in 1988, Professor Barton Miller first proposed Fuzz in his computer laboratory class at the University of Wisconsin. The concept of a Fuzz Generator is used to test the robustness of Unix programs, that is, to test the program with random data until it crashes. Therefore, Professor Barton Miller is also respected by most people as the "father of fuzzy testing".

In 1989, C.J.Cherryh published the novel The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage, which was adapted by the author based on the real experience of tracing hacking attacks, and proposed the prototype of honeypot technology in the book.

In 1990, some network firewall products began to appear. At this time, they were mainly network-based firewalls that could handle applications such as FTP.

Since 1993, Jeff Moss has held DEFCON every year in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA (also written as DEFCON, Defcon, or DC, one of the world's largest computer security conferences). The CTF (Capture The Flag) competition also originated from DEFCON in 1996.

In July 1993, Windows NT 3.1 was released, introducing security control mechanisms such as identity authentication, access control and security audit. Before that, the Windows 9x kernel had almost no security mechanism.

In 1996, Smashing the Stack For Fun and Profit made groundbreaking work on how to exploit buffer overflows on the stack.

Since 1997, Jeff Moss has started to hold Black Hat to conduct exchanges and training on information security research from a neutral standpoint. So far, Black Hat will also be held in Europe and Asia.

In December 1998, Jeff Forristal mentioned an example of using SQL injection techniques to attack a website in an article <http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=54&id=8>`_. From then on, SQL injection has begun to be widely discussed.

On the WorkShop of the 2nd Research with Security Vulnerability Databases from January 21 to 22, 1999, MITRE founders David E. Mann and Steven M. Christey published an article titled "Towards a Common Enumeration of Vulnerability" The white paper proposes the concept of CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), and included and disclosed 321 CVE vulnerabilities that year.

In December 1999, some engineers at MSRC discovered some examples of websites being injected with code, and they exposed this attack after sorting out the discussion, called Cross Site Scripting.

In January 2002, Microsoft launched the Trustworthy Computing program to help ensure products and services are highly secure, available, reliable, and business integrity in nature. SDL (Security Development Lifecycle) is also here. It was proposed at this time.

On September 9, 2001, Mark Curphey launched the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) project and began to provide some articles, methods and tools for web attack technology in the community.

After this, concepts such as Responsible disclosure/Full disclosure have also continued to enter people's vision.

On October 4, 2002, The Art of Deception was published by Kevin Mitnick. This book details how social engineering is applied in attacks. Kevin Mitnick is also considered social engineering. The founder of the mountain.

On July 25, 2005, Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) was created to encourage responsible vulnerability disclosure.

In November 2005, based on the accumulation and development of intelligence collection since February 1941, Director of National Intelligence announced the establishment of Open Source Center (OSC) to collect open source intelligence, and then the concept of Open-source intelligence (OSINT) continued to continue. Being recognized by people.

In 2006, the concept of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) attack was formally proposed to describe hidden and ongoing cyberattacks discovered in U.S. military and government networks from the late 1990s to the early 2000s.

Since 2006, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has begun to hold a series of national-level cyber incident exercises every two years.

With the continuous development of the times, offensive and defensive technology has changed greatly, and defense methods and security awareness have evolved. Before the attack occurs, there are mechanisms such as threat intelligence and blacklist sharing, so that the threat can be spread in a timely manner. When an attack occurs, there are firewalls based on various mechanisms such as keyword detection, semantic analysis, and deep learning. Some defense mechanisms can even defend against zero-day attacks to a certain extent. After the attack occurs, some key system systems are isolated, and the attack results are difficult to expand, and even if the target is obtained, it is difficult to conduct further attacks. Some target honeypots have a high degree of simulation, with normal services and some business data that are difficult to judge true or false.

In June 2010, Stuxnet was discovered that after that supply chain attacks began to become one of the emerging threats to cyberspace security. Subsequent supply chain attacks such as XcodeGhost and CCleaner have had significant impacts.

In 2010, analysts at Forrester Research Inc. proposed a conceptual model of “zero trust”.

In January 2012, Gartner proposed the concept of IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing), providing a solution combining DAST and SAST technologies. This method has a high vulnerability detection rate and a low false alarm rate. At the same time, it can be located at API interfaces and code snippets.

In September 2012, David Cearley, a researcher at Gartner, proposed the concept of DevSecOps, saying that the process of DevOps should include security concepts.

In 2013, MITRE proposed ATT&CK™ (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge, ATT&CK), a model that describes the technologies used in each stage of an attack from the perspective of an attacker.

In 2013, Michigan University started the ZMap project, which evolved into Censys in 2015, and since then, the project of cyberspace surveying and mapping has gradually emerged.

In 2014, the concept of Runtime Application Self-protection (RASP) was proposed to protect security at the application layer.

In 2015, Gartner first proposed the concept of SOAR, the initial definition was Security Operations, Analytics and Reporting, namely security operation and maintenance analysis and reporting.

In 2017, Gartner redefines the concept of SOAR: Security Orchestration, Automation and Response, namely security orchestration, automation and response.
