ECMAScript
========================================

Introduction
----------------------------------------
ECMAScript is a script programming language standardized by ECMA International through ECMA-262. It is often called JavaScript or JScript. Simple, it can be considered that ECMAScript is a standard for JavaScript, but in fact the latter two are implementations and extensions of the ECMA-262 standard.

Version
----------------------------------------
In June 1997, the first edition was released. In June 1998, the format was revised so that its form is consistent with the ISO/IEC16262 international standard. In December 1999, powerful regular expressions, better lexical scope chain processing, new control instructions, exception handling, clearer error definitions, formatting of data output and other changes. Later, due to differences about the complexity of the language, the fourth version was abandoned, and some of them became the basis of the fifth version and Harmony.

In December 2009, the fifth edition was released, adding "strict mode", which clarified many fuzzy specifications in version 3 and adapted to real-world implementation behaviors that were inconsistent with the norms. Some new features have been added, such as getters and setters, support for JSON and more complete reflection on object properties.

In June 2015, the 6th edition was released, first known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6), adding classes and module syntax, iterators, Python-style generators and generator expressions, arrow functions, binary data, static Type arrays, sets (maps, sets and weak maps), promises, reflection and proxies.

In June 2016, ECMAScript 2016 (ES2016) was released, introducing new features such as ``Array.prototype.includes`, exponential operators, SIMD.

In June 2017, ECMAScript 2017 (ES2017) was released, with multiple new concepts and language features.

In June 2018, ECMAScript 2018 (ES2018) released includes asynchronous loops, generators, new regular expression features and rest/spread syntax.

ES6 characteristics
