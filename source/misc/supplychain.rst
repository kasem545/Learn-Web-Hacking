Supply Chain Security
========================================

Introduction
----------------------------------------
Supply chain security is to ensure that all links in the software development and delivery process are secure to prevent malicious attackers from implanting malicious code or vulnerabilities during the software development and delivery process, thereby protecting the security and privacy of the end users.

Supply chain security includes security guarantees throughout the life cycle from software development, testing, deployment, maintenance to updates, to ensure the integrity, reliability and security of the software. In the current digital age, supply chain security has become a very important topic because malicious attackers can use supply chain attacks to invade enterprises and individual computer systems, steal sensitive information or destroy systems. Therefore, supply chain security has become one of the security issues that enterprises and organizations must pay attention to.

Traditional security defense measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, etc. can be bypassed. In addition, because the links in the supply chain are very complex, the attacker can choose to attack any of them, making defense more difficult.

Supply chain security issues
----------------------------------------

Supply chain failure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Supply chain failure refers to a malicious attacker attacking the supplier and entering the user's computer system or network through the supplier's link.

Supply Chain Backdoor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Supply chain backdoor refers to the system provided by the supplier that has a preset backdoor, default password or reserved debugging interface.

Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Supply chain vulnerabilities refer to security vulnerabilities in supply chain software that can be exploited by attackers to hack into the end user's computer system.

Supply chain vulnerabilities are usually caused by defects or errors in software development, testing, deployment, maintenance and other links.

Supply chain pollution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Supply chain pollution refers to the malicious attacker implanting malicious code or vulnerabilities into the software by attacking one or more links in the software supply chain, thus causing the end user's computer system or network to be attacked.

Unlike supply chain backdoors, supply chain pollution usually refers to malicious code or vulnerability implanted by an attacker in the software supply chain, and is not necessarily a special backdoor.

Supply Chain Data Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Supply chain data security refers to the situation where privacy and sensitive data are leaked in the supply chain.

Common attack methods
----------------------------------------
- Create a package with a similar name
- Combosquatting
- Typosquatting
- Modify word order
- Modify the splitter
- Inject dependencies
- Named internal package
- Influence construction
- Exploiting CI/CD vulnerabilities
- Submit backdoor code
- Hijacking the developer account
- Submit logic hidden backdoor
- Hide submission logic with rendering problems
- Homoglyph
- Unicode Bidirectional
- Other control characters
- Obfuscation / minified
