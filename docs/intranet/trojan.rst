No killing at the back door
----------------------------------------
- Traditional static code detection
- Add shell
- Add flower instruction
- Entry table without killing
- Heuristic code detection
- Dynamic function calls
- Yunchao Kill
- Dynamically increase your body volume
- Change the domain name resolution address of the cloud check server
- Disconnected
- Bypass the cloud's "whitelist" using hash collisions
- Attack the main anti-virus software
- Change system time
- Window message attack
- Actively send IRP to control the main anti-driver
- Utilize certificate trust
- Stealing and exploiting legal certificates
- Forge certificates using hash collision
- "White and Black" of DLL hijacking problems using legal procedures

Testing technology
----------------------------------------
- Detection based on self-start information
- Process information-based detection
- Data transmission-based detection
- Rootkit/Bootkit detection

Backdoor analysis
----------------------------------------
- Dynamic Analysis
- Static analysis
- Anti-virus engine scanning
- File format recognition
- File shelling identification and shelling
- plain text string search
- Link library and import/export function analysis
