========================================
Cluster security considers several goals:

- Ensure the isolation of the container and the host
- Limit the interference caused by containers to infrastructure/other containers
- Minimum permission principle
- Clarify component boundary division
- Divide the roles of ordinary users and administrators
- Assign administrator permissions to users if necessary
- Allow applications with Secret data to run in the cluster
