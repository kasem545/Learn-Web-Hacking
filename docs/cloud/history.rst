History of cloud development
========================================

Between 2000 and 2010, cloud computing mainly developed in the direction of IaaS.
Before this stage, hardware and computer rooms were maintained independently, and the operation and maintenance costs were high. Difficult to deploy and migrate applications, poor isolation. Therefore, IaaS emerged, using infrastructure as a service and reducing marginal costs through large-scale deployment.
At the heart of IaaS are various virtualization technologies.
During this period of time, many related virtualization tools and commercial products have emerged.

In 2000, FreeBSD Jail implemented the first complete operating system virtualization technology.
In 2001, VMWare released ESX and GSX, launching virtualization technology. In the same year, QEMU based on dynamic binary translation was released.
In 2002, Amazon launched Amazon Web Services.
In 2005, Intel launched VT-x hardware assisted virtualization technology.
In 2006, KVM was born. In the same year, Amazon released EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) and S3 (Simple Storage Service) products.
In 2008, Google released the first version of Google App Engine.
In 2010, Microsoft released Microsoft Azure.
In 2010, the open source software OpenStack was released and a community was established. OpenStack is essentially a set of automation tool scripts that allocate and manage virtual machines. After the release of OpenStack, many IaaS manufacturers have used OpenStack.

The IaaS platform improves the utilization efficiency of physical resources to a certain extent, but virtual machines still have limitations in resource utilization. Then between 2011 and 2013, PaaS began to take shape to support the full life cycle of applications and provide the ability to host applications.

In 2011, CloudFoundry, developed by VMWare, was open sourced as the first PaaS platform. Supports application packaging, deployment, operation in container mode, load balancing and other functions.
In November 2011, Google Compute Engine was released.
In 2012, OpenShift was open source.
In 2013, Docker was open sourced and released, solving the problem of inconsistent application development, testing and generation environments through mirroring.

After 2013, cloud computing has become more and more mature. The scale is getting bigger and bigger, and the scale deployment and management of containers have become a problem. Docker released Swarm, while Google released Kubernetes.

In 2013, the concept of cloud native was proposed.
In 2014, Google released Kubernetes.
In 2015, Google announced the establishment of the CNCF Foundation (cloud native computing).
