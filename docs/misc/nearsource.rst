Near source permeability
========================================

USB attack
----------------------------------------

BadUSB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Perform malicious actions by reprogramming the internal microcontroller of the USB device, such as registering as a keyboard device, sending specific keys for malicious actions.

Autorun
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Depending on the host configuration, some operating systems will automatically execute predetermined files located on the USB device memory. Malware can be executed in this way.

USB Killer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The device is permanently destroyed by special USB devices based on electrical and other methods.

Side channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some monitoring/test channel transmission devices are added by modifying USB.

HID Attack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HID (human interface device) refers to a human-computer interaction device used to provide data input to a computer, such as a keyboard, a mouse, etc. HID attack refers to an attacker emulating a special USB device into a keyboard and performing a predetermined malicious operation once it is connected to the computer. HID attacks can be implemented based on Android devices, data line devices, etc.

In
----------------------------------------

Password blasting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Based on WPA2 verification method, Wi-Fi can crack offline passwords by grabbing handbags.

Signal suppression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A high-powered device can be used to capture the handshake packet and mimic the target AP, thereby enabling a man-in-the-middle attack.

Access control
----------------------------------------

Electromagnetic pulse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In some electronic systems with electronic access control and electronic password locks, integrated circuits are more sensitive to electromagnetic pulses, and can destroy the equipment by adding electromagnetic pulses (EMP) to achieve the opening effect.

IC card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Equipment based on chameleons and other devices can use simulation, cracking, and copying IC cards to crack access control.
