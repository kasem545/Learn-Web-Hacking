Threat intelligence
========================================

Introduction
----------------------------------------

Cause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The new generation of attackers often launch targeted cyber attacks on enterprises and organizations. This highly targeted attack is usually carefully planned, with complex attack methods and channels, and serious consequences. When facing such an attack, there are serious ambitions in offense and defense. In order to eliminate this ambition as much as possible, Threat Intelligence came into being.

definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Threat Intelligence, also known as Security Intelligence, Security Threat Intelligence.

There are many definitions of threat intelligence, generally referring to information extracted from security data related to cyberspace threats, including the source of threats, intent of attack, attack methods, attack target information, and knowledge that can be used to resolve threats or deal with hazards. . The broad threat intelligence also includes the processing, production, analysis and application of intelligence and the collaborative sharing mechanism. Related concepts include assets, threats, vulnerabilities, etc., and the specific definitions are as follows.

General threat intelligence needs to include the source of threat, the purpose of the attack, the object of attack, the attack method, the vulnerability, the attack characteristics, the defense measures, etc. Threat intelligence can serve as an early warning beforehand, assist in detection and response when a threat occurs, and can be used for analysis and traceability afterwards.

Common cyber threat intelligence services include hacker or fraud group analysis, social media and open source information monitoring, targeted vulnerability research, customized manual analysis, real-time event notification, credential recovery, accident investigation, forged domain name detection, etc.

In terms of threat intelligence, more representative manufacturers include BAE Systems Applied Intelligence, Booz Allen, RSA, IBM, McAfee, Symantec, FireEye, etc.

Related concepts
----------------------------------------

Asset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Information or resources that are valuable to the organization are internal intelligence and are discovered through asset surveying and mapping.

Threat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Able to cause potential harm to the system through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, data modification and or denial of service, threats can be attributed to the subject of the threat (threat source), capabilities, resources, motivation, pathways, possibilities and consequences, etc. Come and carve

Vulnerability/Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Assets that may be threatened such as attackers exploit or several asset weaknesses.

The vulnerability exists for multiple cycles, which was first discovered by security researchers or attackers, and then appeared in community announcements/official emails/blogs. With the continuous transmission of information, vulnerability information appears in open source communities and other places, with PoC and vulnerability details analysis. Then, automation tools began to spread on a large scale, and some vulnerabilities will have social impacts and be reported by the media, and finally the vulnerabilities will be basically fixed.

Risk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The potential possibility of threatening to exploit the vulnerability of an asset or a group of assets to harm the organization.

Security Events (Event)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Scenarios where threats to exploit the vulnerability of assets actually cause harm.

Source of information
----------------------------------------
In order to achieve synchronization and exchange of intelligence, each organization has formulated corresponding standards and specifications. The main ones are national standards, US federal government standards, etc.

In addition to the country, enterprises also have their own sources of intelligence, such as manufacturers, CERT, developer community, security media, vulnerability authors or teams, official accounts, personal blogs, code warehouses, etc.

Threat Framework
----------------------------------------
The more influential threat frameworks include Lockheed Martin's Cyber Kill Chain Framework, MITRE's ATT&CK framework (Common Knowledge base of Adversary Tactics and Techniques), and ODNI's CCTF framework (Common Cyber Threat Framework, Public cyberspace threat framework), and NSA's TCTF framework (Technical Cyber Threat Framework).
