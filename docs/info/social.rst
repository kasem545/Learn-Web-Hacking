Corporate information collection
----------------------------------------
Some websites such as Tianyan Check can provide information inquiries such as corporate relationship mining, industrial and commercial information, trademark patents, and corporate annual reports, and can provide more detailed information about the company.

There will be information on business directions, cooperative units and other information on the company's main website.

Personnel information collection
----------------------------------------
Information collection for personnel is considered to collect and analyze targeted important personnel, organizational structures, and social relations. Among them, important personnel mainly refer to the personal computers of senior executives, system administrators, development, operation and maintenance, finance, personnel, and business personnel.

The entry point for collecting personnel information is easier to use is the website, which may contain information about personnel such as website development, management and maintenance. The names and email addresses and other contact information of all developers and all contact information that can be obtained from the comment information of the website contact function and code.

After obtaining this information, you can further find all the information about the target site posted by these people on the Internet on social and recruitment websites such as Github/Linkedin, and analyze and discover useful information.

In addition, the obtained email can be blasted by password to obtain the corresponding password.

fishing
----------------------------------------
Based on the information collected before, you can use file formats such as Office/CHM/RAR/EXE/shortcuts to create phishing emails to send to the target to further collect information.

Among them, Office can use Office vulnerabilities, macros, OLE objects, PPSX and other methods to construct utilization files.

Exe can use special Unicode control characters such as RLO (Right-to-Left Override) to build confusing file names.

RAR mainly uses self-decompression and other methods to build malicious files. Similarly, encrypted compressed packages can escape the detection of the email gateway to a certain extent.

If the email address of operation and maintenance personnel is obtained during the early collection of information, it can be sent using the email address of operation and maintenance personnel. If no relevant information is collected, the email address can be sent using the method of forged sending sources.

It should be noted that phishing testing also requires attention to compliance issues, and cannot impersonate regulatory units or send illegal and irregular information. For details, please refer to the "Telecommunication Regulations of the People's Republic of China" and the "Regulations on the Management of Internet Email Services of the People's Republic of China".
