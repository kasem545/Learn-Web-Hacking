Network security concept
========================================

Network Security Definition
----------------------------------------
A general definition of network security means that the hardware, software and data in the network information system are protected and are not damaged, changed or leaked by accident or maliciously. The system can operate continuously, reliably and normally without interruption of services. Network security is simply the ability to identify and eliminate unsafe factors in a network environment.

Network security has different explanations in different environments and applications, such as the security of system operation, the security of system information content, and the security of information communication and dissemination.

The basic requirements for network security include reliability, availability, confidentiality, integrity, non-refutability, controllability, censorship, authenticity, etc. The three most basic elements are confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Confidentiality is a feature that does not leak useful information to unauthorized users. It can be achieved through technologies such as information encryption, identity authentication, access control, secure communication protocols, etc. Information encryption is the most basic means to prevent illegal information leakage, and mainly emphasizes the characteristics of useful information being used only by authorized objects.

Integrity refers to the characteristics of keeping information from being destroyed or modified, lost, and unauthorized during transmission, exchange, storage and processing of information, and is also the most basic security feature.

Availability refers to the characteristics in which the information resource can be accessed by an authorized entity as required, used normally, or restored to use under abnormal circumstances. The required information is correctly accessed while the system is running, and can be quickly restored and put into use when the system is subject to accidental attacks or damages. It is a kind of security performance of network information systems for users to ensure the provision of services to users.

The main body of network security is to protect the security of data and communications on the network. Data security refers to software and hardware protection measures to prevent unauthorized leakage, transfer, modification and damage of data. Communication security is a communication protection measure. , it is required to adopt confidentiality security, transmission security, radiation security and other measures in communication.

System fragility
----------------------------------------
The information system itself is fragile. The hardware resources, communication resources, software and information resources of the information system may cause the system to be destroyed, changed, leaked and functionally invalid due to foreseeable or unforeseeable or even malicious reasons, thus causing the system to be damaged, changed, leaked, and invalidated. In an abnormal state, even collapsed and paralyzed.

The vulnerability of hardware resources is mainly manifested in physical security issues, mostly due to design, and the method of using software programs is not very effective.

The fragility of software comes from legacy issues in design and software engineering implementation, such as negligence in design, logical confusion in internal design, and failure to comply with information system security principles for design.
