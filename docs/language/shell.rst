Shell
================================

Introduction
----------------------------------------
Shell is a special program that is a bridge for users to use Linux. Shell is both a command and a programming language.

Linux contains a variety of shells, common ones include:

- Bourne Shell (ATT's Bourne development, called sh)
- Bourne Again Shell（/bin/bash）
- C Shell (developed by Bill Joy, named csh)
- K Shell (developed by ATT by David G.koun, named ksh)
- Z Shell (developed by Paul Falstad, named zsh)

Metacharacter
----------------------------------------
The shell generally has a series of special characters to achieve certain effects. This character is called a metacharacter (Meta), and the metacharacter supported by different shells may be different.

Common meta characters are as follows:

- ``IFS`` consists of one of <space> or <tab> or <enter>
- ``CR`` is generated by <enter>.
- ``=`` Set variable
- ``$`` is used as variable or operation replacement
- ``>`` redirect stdout
- ``>``` append to file
- ``<`` redirect stdin
- ``|`` command pipeline
- ``&`` commands executed in the background
- ``;`` After the previous command is finished, execute the next command
- ``&&`` After the previous command has not been executed without an error, execute the next command
- ``||`` After the previous command has been executed, execute the next command
- ````` commands in single quotes retain the original value
- ``"`` commands in double quotes will allow variable replacement
- `````` content in the backtick mark will be executed as a command and replaced
- ``()`` execute command in a child shell
- ``{}``Execute command in the current shell
- ``~`` Home directory of the current user
- ``!number`` Execute historical commands such as ``!1``

Wildcard
----------------------------------------
In addition to meta characters, wildcard is also a special character in the shell. When a shell encounters a wildcard in the parameter, the shell will use it as a path or file name to search for possible matches on the disk: if the match that meets the requirements exists, it will be replaced, otherwise the wildcard will be directly used as a normal character. transfer.

Common wildcard characters are as follows:

- ``*`` Match 0 or more characters
- ``?`` Match any character
- ``[list]`` Match any character in list
- ``[!list]`` Match any character except list
- ``[a-c]`` Match any character in a-c
- ``{string1,string2,...}`` matches the strings respectively
